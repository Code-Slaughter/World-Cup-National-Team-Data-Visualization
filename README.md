## EPFL COM-480 Data Visualisation Project

### Introduction
- In the face of the upcoming 2022 World Cup, we wanted to visualize in our project the previous head-to-head records of the World Cup teams,
the information of each team, and the information of each player. Our target audience is everyone who wants to know and see the World Cup data. 
In our website, you can see the head-to-head records of the teams, each team's match records in recent years, player information, etc.
It is also possible to compare the teams that are about to play against each other, giving a more intuitive feeling from the data.

### Progress of our implementaton
- We will provided you with files about the process from the very beginning idea to the final project.
  - [Milestone 1](M1.md) illustrates our design strategy of our visualization, related information collected and approaches of data pre-processing in the initial stages.
  - [Milestone 2](M2.pdf) marks a clear understanding of the overall visualization, including our description of the specific functions that will be implemented, the 
technology might be using, as well as some extra ideas about the visualization.
